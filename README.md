##  Featured Portfolio Projects

### 1. [Breast Cancer Diagnostic Classification](bamideleadedeji) 
* **The Goal:** Classify cell nuclei as Malignant or Benign with 98% Recall.
* **The Tech:** Implemented **SVM** and handled **Multicollinearity** by removing redundant 90%+ correlated features.
* **Impact:** Prioritizes clinical safety by minimizing false negatives in cancer detection.

### 2. [Heart Disease Risk Prediction](bamideleadedeji) 
* **The Goal:** Identify high-risk cardiac patients using clinical indicators.
* **The Tech:** Used **Logistic Regression** and **Feature Importance** to rank risk factors like age and cholesterol.
* **Impact:** Provides a baseline for preventative medical screening tools.

### 3. [Hospital No-Show: Operational Intelligence]((bamideleadedeji) 
* **The Goal:** Predict patient attendance to improve clinic efficiency.
* **The Tech:** Utilized **Random Forest** and engineered a `WaitDays` feature. 
* **The Solve:** Successfully bypassed network connectivity blockers (WinError 10060) by building a custom **Data Simulation Engine**.
